John Morrissey, <jwm@horde.net>,
http://horde.net/~jwm/software/mod_ldap_userdir/. Feedback is much
appreciated. If you're using mod_ldap_userdir successfully, are having
problems getting mod_ldap up and running at your site, or have some code
improvements or ideas for development, please let me know!

================================================
2. How do I install and set up mod_ldap_userdir?
================================================

* gzip -dc mod_ldap_userdir-1.0.1.tar.gz | tar xf -
* cd mod_ldap_userdir-1.0.1
* ./configure --with-activate
* make
* make install
* If your LDAP server runs OpenLDAP 1.x, you need to add the posixAccount
  schema definition.  Add the contents of posixAccount-objectclass to your
  slapd.oc.conf and restart your LDAP server. OpenLDAP 2.x (and most other
  LDAP servers) ship with this schema predefined.
* The 'user-ldif' file contains a sample user ldif. Modify it to your liking
  and say ldapadd -D your-root-dn -w your-root-dn-password < ldif
* You are *strongly* encouraged to read up on the LDAP config-file
  directives in the DIRECTIVES file, included with the distribution. At bare
  minimum, you'll need to have LDAPUserDir, LDAPUserDirDNInfo, and
  LDAPUserDirBaseDN configuration directives in your httpd.conf.

  A set of basic mod_ldap_userdir configuration directives would look like:

    LDAPUserDir        public_html
    LDAPUserDirDNInfo  cn=your-dn,dc=example,dc=com dnpass
    LDAPUserDirBaseDN  ou=People,dc=example,dc=com

  Of course, you will need to update these configuration directives with
  the proper values for your environment.

3. Changes
==========

v1.0.1:
* Fixed a couple hard-coded references to the "homeDirectory" attr. (Thanks
  to Christian Zoffoli [czoffoli at xmerlin dot org] for pointing this out.)

v1.0:
* Initial revision of standalone module. mod_ldap_userdir includes the same
  functionality as apache-userdirldap 1.5 and adds TLS/SSL support for
  connections to the LDAP server.

========
4. To Do
========

* Currently, nothing.

  apache-userdirldap.
